# odin-recipes
This is the first project im doing with the help of TheOdinProject course,
    In this project Im planning to display the skills I have obtained so far in this course which is.
        - Fundamentals of linux terminal navigation
        - Basic workflow for git and github
        - Beginner level HTML coding
        
In the future as I follow through the Odin course I may comeback again and update this project to become more appealing.
